# Unsupervised-Learning

Extensive documentation is included in the notebook. 

You should download the water.csv file. Ensure notebook and file are in the same directory.

You might have to install the yellowbrick package (it's a fairly common python package for visualizing ML algorithms).

Contained in the notebook is an extensive description (justification) of clustering algorithms suitable for unsupervised learning of water molecules
